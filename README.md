# House Price Prediction Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is about predicting house prices using a **Linear Regression Model built from scratch**. We will not use external ML libraries like Scikit-Learn. Instead, we will implement everything using just **NumPy and Pandas**. This project is great for beginners to understand how Machine Learning models work under the hood.

## 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **EDA file** helps us understand the data before building a model. It cleans the data, removes missing values, and finds patterns. We explore how income, population, and location affect house prices. This step helps us see important relationships and trends in the dataset. The insights from EDA guide us in selecting the best features for prediction.

### **EDA Steps Performed:**
1️⃣ **Income vs. House Prices** – Do high-income areas have expensive houses?
2️⃣ **Population Density Impact** – Do crowded places have lower or higher prices?
3️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Creating new features like rooms per household.
4️⃣ **House Age Distribution** – Are older houses more expensive or cheaper?
5️⃣ **Geospatial Analysis** – Mapping house prices across locations.

These steps help us understand the **key factors** that affect house prices before training a model.
